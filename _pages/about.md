Hi, I'm **Chenxi Song**, currently a postdoctoral researcher at AGI Lab, Westlake University, supervised by Prof. [Chi Zhang](https://icoz69.github.io/). I received my Ph.D. degree in Engineering from Jilin University in 2024, where I focused on 3D Computer Vision and Computer Graphics under the supervision of Prof. [Shigang Wang](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/info/1066/7660.htm), with co-supervision from Prof. [Jian Wei](https://wei-jian.github.io/about/) and Prof. [Yan Zhao](https://dce.jlu.edu.cn/info/1181/5220.htm).

My current research interests lie in **3D & 4D scene and object controllable generation**. I am actively engaged in the academic community, serving as a reviewer for top-tier AI conferences and journals including NeurIPS, CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, and T-CSVT.

I recently launched a lightweight world model project called **WorldForge**, which will be open-sourced soon. Stay tuned!
