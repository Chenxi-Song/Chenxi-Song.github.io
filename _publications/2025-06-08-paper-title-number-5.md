This paper presents FewarNet, an efficient few-shot view synthesis network that leverages trend regularization techniques to improve the quality of novel view generation from limited input viewpoints. The method addresses the challenging problem of sparse-view multi-view synthesis, which is crucial for various applications in 3D computer vision and computer graphics.
