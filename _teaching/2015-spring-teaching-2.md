**Doctoral Degree Program (2019-2024)**

I pursued my Ph.D. in Information and Communication Engineering at Jilin University, specializing in 3D Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. My doctoral research was supervised by Prof. Shigang Wang, with co-supervision from Prof. Jian Wei and Prof. Yan Zhao.

## Research Focus
- 3D Computer Vision algorithms and techniques
- Computer Graphics and rendering methods
- Multi-view synthesis and view generation
- Stereoscopic display technologies
- Neural rendering and deep learning applications

## Key Research Achievements
- Developed novel approaches for sparse-view multi-view synthesis
- Contributed to LED-based true 3D integral imaging display technology
- Published research in top-tier journals including T-CSVT
- Participated in multiple National Key R&D Program projects
- Gained expertise in both theoretical foundations and practical implementations

## Skills Developed
- Advanced mathematical modeling and analysis
- Deep learning and neural network architectures
- 3D reconstruction and rendering algorithms
- Hardware design for display systems
